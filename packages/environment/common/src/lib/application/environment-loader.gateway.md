# Environment Loader

Loads the environment properties from the provided asynchronous sources.

## API

### Exposed Methods

#### `async load(): Promise<void>`

Loads the application environment properties from the provided asynchronous sources.

Returns a promise to load the application once the required properties are loaded.

#### `async loadSubmodule(name: string, sources: PropertiesSource | PropertiesSource[]): Promise<void>`

Loads the submodule environment properties from the provided asynchronous sources.

Returns a promise to load the submodule once the required properties are loaded.

## Lifecycle Hooks

An `EnvironmentLoader` instance has a lifecycle that starts each time the `load()` or `loadSubmodule()` methods are invoked. Each lifecycle ends when the method returns. Your implementation can use lifecycle hook methods to tap into key events in the environment loader service.

Respond to events in the lifecycle of the loader by implementing one or more of the _lifecycle hook_ interfaces presented below. The hooks give you the opportunity to act on the instance at the appropriate moment.

Each interface defines the prototype for a single hook method, whose name is the interface name starting in lowercase. For example, the `OnBeforeLoad` interface has a hook method named `onBeforeLoad()`.

You don't have to implement all (or any) of the lifecycle hooks, just the ones you need.

### `OnBeforeLoad`

### `OnAfterLoad`

### `OnAfterError`

### `OnAfterComplete`

### `OnBeforeSourceLoad`

### `OnBeforeSourceAdd`

### `OnAfterSourceAdd`

### `OnAfterSourceError`

### `OnAfterSourceComplete`

## Source Middleware

Itâ€™s possible to define middleware functions

### `preAddProperties(properties: Properties, source: LoaderPropertiesSource): Properties`

The `preAddProperties()` middleware is called when we invoke the `EnvironmentService.add()` or `EnvironmentService.merge()` methods with the newly added properties, and gives you the possibility to modify it before inserting it into the environment.

## Examples of use

### Completes after error

Is a common requirement to complete all sources after application load error and reset the environment store.
It's easy to do by implementing `OnAfterLoadError`.

```ts
import { AfterLoadError, EnvironmentLoader, EnvironmentService, PropertiesSource } from '@kaikokeke/environment';

export class CustomEnvironmentLoader extends EnvironmentLoader implements OnAfterLoadError {
  constructor(
    protected readonly service: EnvironmentService,
    protected readonly sources?: PropertiesSource | PropertiesSource[],
  ) {
    super(service, sources);
  }

  protected onAfterLoadError(index: number, name: string, error: Error): void {
    this.onDestroySources(index);
    this.service.reset();
  }
}
```

### Dismiss other sources

If the application must stop loading all the rest of sources after load.

### Load immediately

### Multiple sources ignore error until X error
